Its a mini multiplayer game made base on CodeMonkey Course, but made with some changes(Read more about them a little lower).

## About the game

Pick up some ingredients, prepare them, put them on a plate and deliver them.
Work with the various counters to prepare them.
Pick up a full Cheese block, cut it into slices, then cook a Meat Patty (but don't let it burn!), pick them up on a Plate, add some Bread and you have a nice burger!
